This is a simple python script to download your entire comdirect bank Postbox through comdirect API.

Use at your own risk! I can't be held responsible from any damage, theft or charges to your account. 

Be warned, that there are potential cases that your account might incur charges from comdirect bank.
Some examples are:
- mobileTAN, per sent SMS
- Online banking access getting blocked, after requesting too many or entering too many TANs
- could be more as comdirect AGB (Terms) change

All these potential charges are the responsibility of the user, account owner or user of this piece of software.
